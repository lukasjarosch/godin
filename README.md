# Godin - An opinionated toolkit for Go microservices

> Work in progress

### Protobufs
Protocol buffers are used to describe the APIs of an application.
The API definitions are the heart of a microservice architecture, so a workflow
to organize and automate protobufs should already exist.

I have a basic workflow running here: [lukasjarosch/godin-protobuf](https://github.com/lukasjarosch/godin-protobuf)
